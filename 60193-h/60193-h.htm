<div class='sidenote'><h2>AT VILLENEUVE-LÈS AVIGNON</h2><br />April 23</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>On the roof of the ruined church
we lay, basking amid the hot,
powdery heather; the cinder-coloured
roofs of the town flattened out beneath
us—a ragged patch of dead,
decayed colour, burnt, as it seemed,
out of the rank, luscious green of the
Rhône valley. Overhead, a thick,
blue sky hung heavy, and away and
away, into the steamy haze of midday
heat, filtered the Tarascon road, a
streak of dazzling white. To the
east, the sun was beating on the sandy
slopes; to the west, the old Papal
palace, like a great, grey, sleeping
beast, lifted its long, bare back above
the roofs of Avignon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lizards scurried from cranny
to cranny across the crumbling
wall. Below, in the cloister, a cat
was curled by a black stack of brushwood.
The little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place</span></i> stood empty,
and stillness seemed to have fallen
over all things.</p>

<p class='c008'>The warmth lulled one to a delicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>torpor. I was thinking of the
bustling Regent Street pavement, of
the rumble of Piccadilly, of newsboys
yelling special editions in the Strand,
drowsily conjuring up these and other
commonplace contrasts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Jeanne-Marie Latou began
to speak. She sat between us, with
her legs hunched under her coarse,
colourless skirt, and some stray wisps
of hair looking dingily yellow against
the clean white of her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffe</span></i>. As she
talked, her brown skin puckered oddly
about her tiny, shrunken eyes, and
her hands—browned also and squat—clasped
themselves around her knees.
It was not often that Jeanne-Marie
Latou spoke French; her vocabulary
was quite simple and limited, and
every now and then, with an impatient
shake of her head, she would
break out into <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was telling us of her nephew
in Tunis—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un pays où on ne voit que
des sauvages</span></i>”—and of the sweetheart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>he had left behind at Barbentane;
repeating by heart, one after another,
his queer, bald, little letters—how he
had been kicked by his horse (he was
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spahi</span></i>; “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">zouave à cheval</span></i>” she called
it), and had been sick ten days in the
hospital; and how, without telling
anyone, she had scraped together a
hundred sous to send out to him.
Somehow, irresistibly, while she chattered,
I seemed to see that soldier
nephew of hers—broad and straight
and bronzed, his fez stuck jauntily
on the back of his head, noisily <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noçant
avec des camarades</span></i> with those hundred
sous, which old Tante Latou had sent
out to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>By-and-bye, she related her journey
to Valence, in the time when she
had worked as a cherry-packer for
Madame Charbonnier in the Rue
Joseph-Vernet, insisting with comical,
energetic wrinklings of her forehead
on her contempt for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jargon
de l’Ardèche</span></i>.... She had been to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Marseilles, too, last year—that was a
great journey—eighteen of them had
gone from Villeneuve, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femmes et
filles et trois garçons, dans un train
‘ambulant’—quatre francs et douze sous,
aller et retour ....  Marseilles,
vous savez</span></i>,” Jeanne-Marie Latou reiterated,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est quelque chose ...
c’est quelque chose ... c’est quelque
chose ... enfin, c’est la plus jolie
ville que j’ai trouvée</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards, starting to recall bygone
times, she described the breaking
up of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chartreuse</span></i> in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quatre-vingt
douze</span></i>, and the selling of the whole
building by auction in the little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place</span></i>,
there, below us (not for money—no
one in the <em>pays</em> had any money in
those days—but for <i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">assignats</span></i>), and,
Jeanne-Marie Latou explained, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ceux
qui avaient peur n’en prenaient pas, et
ceux qui n’avaient pas peur en prenaient</span></i>.”
And her father, who had
been a stone-worker, over there at
Les Angles, had bid <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douze cents francs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>d’assignats</span></i> for the house where the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">supérieure</span></i> had lived—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douze cents francs
d’assignats</span></i> which no one had ever
asked him to pay. There Jeanne-Marie
Latou had always lived—seventy-seven
years, it was now, as
near as she could remember—she,
and her husband who had been dead
these twenty-three years. She could
remember the time when the frescoes
on the cloister walls were bright and
beautiful, and no grass grew between
the flags. Yes, she had seen all the
other houses pass from family to
family; there were six of them now
who had the right to use the old
church as a barn, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma foi, elle est bien
grande, l’église</span></i>,” Jeanne-Marie Latou
concluded, smiling knowingly at us,
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, quand même, ils se chicanent
toujours.</span></i>”...</p>

<p class='c008'>And with that, she rose slowly and
bid us good-bye, and wished us good
health, toddling grotesquely away
down the steps.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>After she had gone, we stayed a
long while up on the hot roof, watching
the dark shadows creep from
under the broken bridge across the
rippling Rhône, as it swept past towards
the sea. And I wondered more
drowsily than ever concerning old
Jeanne-Marie Latou, and her soldier
nephew, with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spahis</span></i>, away over
there in Tunis, and that great journey
of hers to Marseilles—eighteen
of them from the dead little town
below, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femmes et filles et trois garçons,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The population pours out from
mass, flooding every crooked

<p class='c008'>A bleating of lambs, plaintive, incessant
and dirge-like, fills the <em>Place du

lie, their legs tied under their bellies,
and their skinny necks helplessly outstretched:
and beyond, the great,
green umbrellas of a regiment of
wrinkled beldams—fruit-sellers encamped
in rows before their baskets....
A strange complication of
odours—of cheese, of fish and of
flowers—floats in the air: at every
alley-corner some auctioneer stands
posted—shouting, perspiring vendors
of knives, pocket-books, glass-cutters,
chromo-lithographs, cement, songs,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sabots</span></i>. An old top-hatted Jew nasally
vaunts a wine-testing fluid, and tells
horrible and interminable tales of vintages
manufactured from decayed dates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>from vinegar and sugar, or from plaster-of-Paris;
a travelling pedicure operates
on the box-seat of a gorgeously-painted
van, to the accompaniment of a big
drum and clashing cymbals; the inevitable
strong man defiantly challenges
the crowd to split a flag-stone across his
bare, hirsute chest; and a blind-folded
fortune-telling wench chaunts with
mechanical shamelessness the young
men’s amorous indiscretions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Outside the town, the boulevard is
gay with the glitter of pedlars’ wares,
and flapping, gaudy stuffs, red, green
and yellow and blue; travelling showmen
are bustling with final preparations,
hammering together their skeleton
booths, or unfolding gaunt rolls of
battered canvas; the steam-orchestra
of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Musée fin de siècle</span></i> bellows
from its rows of brass-mouthed trumpets
a deafening, wheezy tune; and
everywhere, beneath the tunnel of pale

grasshoppers, with their great sensitive

fierce-looking flying things, their vivid

darting capriciously to and fro.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>I went there again to-day; but
I did not see her. It is a year
now since I met her, sitting alone
before her basket, in a corner of the
deserted square. Her face was tanned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>deep russet, and wrinkled to a tragic
listlessness; she had eyebrows white
as clean linen, and full-veined, tremulous
hands. When I first spoke to
her, I did not know that she was
blind. She pulled some handkerchiefs
from her basket, and offered them to
me in a quavering, far-away voice,
explaining that she had hemmed them
herself; for she had been brought up
as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couturière</span></i>. I asked her how
long she had been blind:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is forty-eight years since I saw
anything, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur</span></i>. When I was

<p class='c008'>She spoke simply, and with quiet

her handkerchiefs with her full-veined,
tremulous hands.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>From afar off, high against the
sky, we could see the ragged
line of its roofs, like an ancient, tattered
crest along the back of a precipitous,
inaccessible-looking hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>To reach it we waded the Luys
de France, with the water swishing
under our horses’ bellies, and climbed
a mule-track, tight-paved with cobbles,
waywardly winding beneath the
contorted limbs of leafy, Spanish
chestnuts. The track led us around
the outside of the village, close under
the shadow of its houses—discoloured-yellow
and musty-white, fissured and
bestained, battered and starved, till
everywhere their bones protruded,
bulging, bursting beams.</p>

<p class='c008'>Low, sloping roofs, moss-grown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the colour of old gold, over-lapped
the walls, like huge, ill-fitting caps;
shading row upon row of wooden
balconies, filled with a decrepid multitude
of things, which, it seemed,
could never have been new—broken
earthenware pots; rickety rush-bottomed
chairs; strips of old linen;
worn-out bass brooms; stacks of dead
branches....</p>

<p class='c008'>Two geese, a yellow dog, and a
little black pig had the village street
all to themselves. The clock on the
tower of the whitewashed church
pointed half-past ten, though the
twilight had not yet come. And
our horses’ hoofs clattered, almost
brutally, past the dank-smelling, mud-floored
rooms, and the cracked, worm-eaten
shutters, wearily moaning with
the dull fatigue of stiff-jointed old
age.</p>

<p class='c008'>Toiling up the hill, on the other
side, we met a crooked old woman,
barefooted, clad in a single frayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>shirt, carrying a truss of sainfoin on
her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<em>Adechats</em>,” she mumbled mechanically,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>All day an intense impression of
lusty sunlight, of quivering
golden-green ... a long, white
road that dazzles, between its rustling
dark-green walls; blue brawling
rivers; swelling upland meadows,
flower-thronged, luscious with tall,
cool grass; the shepherd’s thin-toned
pipe; the ragged flocks, blocking the
road, cropping at the hedge-rows as
they hurry on towards the mountains;
the slow, straining teams of jangling
mules—wine-carriers coming from
Spain; through dank, cobbled village
streets, where the pigs pant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>their bellies in the roadway, and the
sandal-makers flatten the hemp before
their doors; and then, out again
into the lusty sunlight, along the
straight, powdery road that dazzles
ahead interminably towards a mysterious,
hazy horizon, where the land
melts into the sky....</p>

<p class='c008'>And, at last, the cool evening
scents; soft shadows stealing beneath
the still, silent oaks; and, all at once,
a sight of the great snow-mountains,
vague, phantasmagoric, like a mirage

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Since sunrise I had been travelling—along
the straight-stretching
roads, white with summer sand,
interminably striped by the shadows
of the poplars; across the great,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>parched plain, where, all the day’s
length, the heat dances over the
waste land, and the cattle bells float
their far-away tinkling; through the
desolate villages, empty but for the
beldames, hunched in the doorways,
pulling the flax with horny, tremulous
fingers; and on towards the desolate
silence of the flowerless pine-forests....</p>

<p class='c008'>And there the night fell. The sun
went down unseen; a dim flickering
ruddled the host of tree trunks; and
the darkness started to drift through
the forest. The road grew narrow
as a footpath, and the mare slackening
her pace, uneasily strained her
white neck ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of the darkness a figure sprang
beside me. A shout rang out—words
of an uncouth <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</span></i> that I did not
understand. And the mare, terrified,
galloped forward, snorting, and swerving
from side to side....</p>

<p class='c008'>And a strange, superstitious fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>crept over me—a dreamy dread of
the future; a helpless presentiment
of evil days to come; a sense, too,
of the ruthless nullity of life, of the
futile deception of effort, of bitter revolt
against the extinction of death,
a yearning after faith in a vague survival
beyond....</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>PLEASANT COURT</h2><br />June 28</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It is known only to the inhabitants
of the quarter. To find it, you
must penetrate a winding passage,
wedged between high walls of dismal
brick. Turn to the right by the
blue-lettered advertisement of Kop’s
Ale, and again to the left through
the two posts, and you come to
Pleasant-court. And when you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>there, you can go no farther; for
at the far end there is no way out.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are thirteen houses in Pleasant-court—seven
on the one side,
and six on the other. They are alike,
every one; low-walled as country
cottages; built of blackish brick,
with a six-foot plot before each, and
slate roofs that glimmer wanly on
the wet, winter mornings.</p>

<p class='c008'>But winter is not the season to
see Pleasant-court at its best. The
drain-sluice is always getting choked,
so that pools of mud and brown water
loiter near the rickety fence that
flanks each six-foot enclosure; and,
at Christmas-time, “most everyone
is a bit out,” and young Hyams in
the Walworth-road stacks half his
back shop with furniture from Pleasant-court;
and all day long the children
of the lodger at No. 5 never stop
squalling with chapped faces, and the
“Lowser’s” wife makes much commotion
at nights, threatening to “settle”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>her husband, and sending her
four children to clatter about the
pavement.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the summer, however, everyone
smartens up, and by the time that
sultry June days have come, Pleasant-court
attempts a rural air. On
the left-hand side a jaded creeper
pushes its grimy greenery under the
windows; some of the grass plots
grow quite bushy with tough, wizened
stalks; and the geranium pots
at No. 7 strike flaming specks of
vermilion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Last March the “Lowser” and
his wife and his four children moved
over to Southwark; the lodger at
No. 5 is in work again; and now
the quiet of seclusion is restored to
Pleasant-court.</p>

<p class='c008'>The children sprawl the afternoon
through on the hot alley floor; Mrs.
Hodgkiss hangs her washing to bulge
and flap across the court, like a line
of white banners; and on the airless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>evenings, the women, limp, with their
straggling hair, and loose, bedraggled
skirts, lean their bare, fleshy elbows
over the fence, lingering to gossip
before they go to dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>And on Saturday nights, the inhabitants
of Pleasant-court troop out
to join the rumble and the rattle of
the Walworth-road, and to swell the
life that shuffles down its pavement,
past the flaring naphtha lights, the
stall-keepers bawling in the gutter,
and every shop ablaze
with gross jets of gas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>ON THE COAST OF CALVADOS</h2><br />Sept. 26</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The leaden sea plashed her indolent
rhythm: all along the
lonely shore the orchards stood motionless,
sombre, metallic-looking in
the lifeless, thunder-charged air; and
amid a rugged flare of smoky flame,
the sun went down in the West.</p>

<p class='c008'>A baby breeze rustled past, fleeing
before the distant storm: then, all
grew still again, while, across the
horizon, a quiet rift broke, revealing
a long, lurid line of fantastic coast—mysterious,
desolate valleys, and ragged
towering cliffs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The leaden sea plashed her indolent
rhythm; and the bleak bulk of
a steamer, pitching in the offing,
moved like a beast in distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>And once again, fresh and cool,
carrying the scent of the storm, the
breeze came fleeing, trailing an inky
stain over the sea; and across the
West there defiled a vague squadron
of gigantic pillars of rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The parched trees swayed their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>boughs, uneasily whispering; and, of
a sudden, wrapping all things in a
dense shroud of dark-grey mist, clattered
the ponderous rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>And overhead, on, through the
growing night, the white, jagged
flashes of lightning, and the frenzied
flight of the screaming wind, and the
dull booming of thunder told of
the great, distant battle of
the clouds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>AT THE CERTOSA DI VAL D’EMA</h2><br />October 20</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>I sat on the terrace of the old
palace, waiting for the coming
of the rain-clouds. The sunshine was
gone, and with it the city’s witty
sparkle; the sirocco’s breath puffed
warm and moist; and Florence, all
ruddled and sullen, lay chaunting her
ponderous notes of bronze.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below, knee-deep in the yellow,
straggling stream, a fisherman swayed
his net, slowly straining the supple
framework; and while I watched him,
of a sudden, a fitful longing to see
the place again laid hold of me—to
see it, just as it had been last year, on
that mellow September afternoon, all
garnished with soft light, all fragrant
with coquettish simplicity and pleasant,
prosperous peace. And soon, as
the sky darkened, and the rain-clouds—a
sombre, swelling herd—gathered
above the cypresses of San Miniato, I
seemed to hear the organ’s stately
roll, and to perceive, through the
obscurity of the half-darkened chapel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>a crowding circle of white-robed
figures. The chaunt of the church
bells beat the air: all else seemed stilled—love
and the quickening joy of life—and
with a sort of childish inconsequence,
bred perhaps of the curious,
literary habit, I fell to envying them
a little—those tall, white-robed fathers—their
miniature rows of monkish
gardens, and their solitary pacings
beneath the pale-lemon cloisters....</p>

<p class='c008'>So I started to go there, rattling
through the dust in the face of the
coming storm. By the roadside, the
grey olives matched the sky; all
around, the vines hung delicately
dying, drooping in tired curves their
fragile garlands of pallid-gold leaves;
and here and there peeped specks of
scarlet, like lingering traces of some
bygone <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, before we had climbed the
hill, the rain came—a deliberate prelude
of monstrous drops; and a veil,
as of grey gauze, blurred the white-faced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>villas peopling the hill-sides, and
changed the cypresses to dim, spiky
sentinels....</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Brother Agostino who came
to the gate, greeting me, so I fancied,
with a quick smile of recognition;
then, before the groups of noisy village
youths and raffish, Florentine cabmen,
who encumbered the corridor, his
features dropped back to the patient
vacancy of habitual fatigue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Over the tiled floor of the cloister-court
rattled the dance of the rain;
the great well, over-grown with rank
grass, wore a forlorn, decrepit air;
and a musty scent, as of approaching
decay, floated over the vast garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the chapel, a band of blatant
Americans joined us, listening complacently
to Brother Agostino’s perfunctory
explanations concerning the
frescoes, the stained-glass windows,
the exquisite tomb of the monastery’s
founder.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the place seemed all changed:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>its fine distinction was gone: the old
Certosa exposed to the hurried gaze
of every passing tourist; and stern-faced
Brother Agostino, footsore and

vague rumour of awakening life—the
rumble of wheels, the cracking
of whips, the plaintive whistling of
far-off trains....</p>

<p class='c008'>On its way to Florence the early
train swings by; hordes of brown-skinned,

lean idly watching the ceaseless tale

their chairs, to sit at their straw-plaiting
the long day through....</p>

<p class='c008'>Beyond, across the dusty-green of
countless olives, you can see the glittering
roofs of Florence, the <em>Duomo’s</em>
burly dome, and the pale outline of
Giotto’s tower; but it is rather the
sense of old-world slowness, the continual

passing across the street, to disappear,
engulfed in cavernous blackness, beneath
a noisome archway. Bands of

rudely rebuffing the obscene advances

<div class='sidenote'><h3><em>At the Theatre Manzoni</em></h3><br />Nov. 26</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>I have been to many first-nights
there, for I have found a certain
childish charm in the small, shabby,
blue-and-white theatre, the tiers of
minute boxes, close-packed with faces,
the noisy Neapolitan pit, and the inevitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>row of callow critics, sucking
their pencil-stumps, each with his hat
tight-jammed behind his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>But especially there lingers in my
mind the memory of a certain brief,
mediæval drama, where a little flaxen-haired
lady, wearing a low-cut dress
of arsenic-green satin, passionately
implored mercy of a curly-pated
knight in a shirt of maroon-coloured
velvet, for a great wrong she had done
him. She wept piteously, poor little
creature, tearing tremulously at her
fluffy locks, and on her knees appealing
to us all to help her. But the
little knight kept his wooden gaze
obdurately averted from her, till, exhausted,
she sank dying on to a gilt-legged
couch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The actors were only marionettes.
The little lady was somewhat obviously
painted, and the little knight
stood a trifle stiffly, as if suffering
slightly from stage-fright. But the
pit sat the scene out in breathless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>silence, and the row of callow critics
sucked their pencil-stumps with renewed
vigour, and jammed their hats
tighter behind their heads. For in
some curious, inexplicable way the
thing was quite moving—he was so
brutal, the little curly-pated knight
in his shirt of maroon-coloured velvet;
and she, poor, sobbing, little
flaxen-haired lady, pleaded so desperately....</p>

<p class='c008'>Once before, in my childhood,
through a half-closed door, I saw a
girl plead with that same tense fragility.
She, too, had flaxen hair, and
wore a low-necked dress of green
satin; and he, the man, stood stiffly,
turning his gaze away from her, obdurately.
And each scene, as I now
compose them, seems to contain a
kindred underlying element of
grotesque unreality.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was an old mill. There were
white columns of peeling plaster
flanking the granary, and stacks of
frowsy brushwood blocking the door.
Part of it had fallen away; tall, rank
grass grew between the rottening
rafters of the roof; and remnants
of battered frescoes, that had once
adorned the walls of the upper rooms,
were now spread bare to sun and
wind and rain. And the meal-troughs
were full of blossoming wild-flowers.
Beside the mill stood a small, square
Moorish house, roofed with lava,
scowling with dirt; and beside the
house, guarding a public well, was
a gaunt crane of mouldering wood.
Across the sleekly rippling mill-stream
a ragged peasant family were ranged
the length of a strip of powdery soil—the
father, the mother, two sons,
four daughters, and a toddling child—and
beyond them stretched the
great dead-grey expanse of roofless
walls—the sun-dried corpse of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>ruined Roman town. In the twilight
the sea lay towards Capri the colour
of yellow mud; and Vesuvius, turning
a vague, velvety black, was trickling
his smoky breath towards the bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a great immobility in
the air—an immobility that seemed
born of long ages: and, somehow,
more than the ruined town itself—defaced
by German tourists and uniformed
guides—this corner of the
country supplied a bitter sense of
shortness of life, the impassive
sloth of time....</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>To ride alone beneath the stars,
through the long indefinite
hours of the night; to climb the
slumbering mountain-hulks; to hear
the dull roar of the river, toiling
unwearied through the darkness below;
to break, with a sudden clattering
of hoofs, the gloomy stillness of
distant village-streets, and on through
the twilight that precedes the dawn,
to journey, without flagging, high
up against the sky, across a desolate,
limitless plain.</p>

<p class='c008'>To scout the future; to unlearn
the past; and to brood vaguely, as
the night broods....</p>

<p class='c008'>To elude desire; to disdain the
thrill of hate; to forget the long
aching of love, and to commune, in
tender serenity, with the grave-eyed
Spirit of Rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, while the night slinks
away across the hills, to push on
towards the sunrise; to watch the
marshalling of ruddy heralds across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the East, and at last to meet the
Great God’s dazzling glory,
bursting in splendour across
the empty land.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>OFF CAPE TRAFALGAR</h2><br />December 18</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>We paced the bridge together,
chatting till his watch should
be done. The dim, uneasy outline
of the steamer’s bows loomed before
us; now and again we could feel her
pulse quicken, her sinews tighten, as,
like a living thing, she flinched from
each lashing of the waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was telling me tales of the
yellow fever at Rio de Janeiro, of
the crowd of vessels lying in the
harbour without a soul on board, of
six weeks he had spent in the hospital
there, where twelve hundred
fever-stricken creatures lay packed on
the floor of a single ward, and the
doctors dared only shout to the patients
from behind a railed gangway.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>And, while he still talked, up from
the East crept the first flicker of the
dawn, revealing flocks of ruddy-sailed
smacks tossing off the Spanish shore;
then, slowly, the throng of black
billows turned to reddish-green, and
across the sky, from behind the
African coast, poured a deep, blood-red
stain. The mirage rose, lifting
into space the low line of black hills,
and the growing glow set a carpet
of cloud ablaze, till it hung, stretched
across the sky, like a vast awning
of beaten, burnished copper.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>I dreamed of an age grown
strangely picturesque—of the
rich enfeebled by monotonous ease;
of the shivering poor clamouring
nightly for justice; of a helpless
democracy, vast revolt of the ill-informed;
of priests striving to be
rational; of sentimental moralists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>protecting iniquity; of middle-class
princes; of sybaritic saints; of complacent
and pompous politicians; of
doctors hurrying the degeneration of
the race; of artists discarding possibilities
for limitations; of pressmen
befooling a pretentious public; of
critics refining upon the ’busman’s
methods; of inhabitants of Camberwell
chattering of culture.</p>

<p class='c008'>And I dreamed of this great, dreamy
London of ours; of her myriad fleeting
moods; of the charm of her portentous
provinciality; and I awoke
all a-glad and hungering for
life....</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>In the wan, lingering light of the
winter afternoon, the park stood
all deserted; sluggishly drowsing, so
it seemed, with its spacious distances
muffled in greyness; colourless, fabulous,
blurred. One by one, through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the damp, misty air, loomed the tall,
stark, lifeless, elms. Overhead there
lowered a turbid sky, heavy-charged
with an unclean yellow. And, amid
the ruddy patches of dank and rottening
bracken, the little mare picked
her way noiselessly. The rumour of
life seemed hushed; there was only
the vague, listless rhythm of the creaking
saddle....</p>

<p class='c008'>The daylight faded; a shroud of
ghostly mist enveloped the earth,
and up from the vaporous distance
crept slowly the evening
darkness....</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>NEW YEAR’S EVE</h2><br />December 31</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was New Year’s eve. The old,
old scene. A London night; a
heavy-brown atmosphere splashed with
liquid, golden lights; the bustling market-place
of sin; a silent crowd of black
figures drifting over a wet, flickering
pavement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The slow, grave notes from a church
tower took command of the night.
The last one faded: the old year had
slipped by. And then a woman laughed—a
strident, level laugh; and there
swept through all the crowd a mad,
feverish tremor. The women ran one
to the other, kissing, wildly welcoming
the New Year in; and the men,
shouting thickly, snatched at them as
they ran. And the cabmen touted
eagerly for fares.</p>

<p class='c008'>Across the road, by a corner, a
street missionary stood on a chair—an
undersized, poorly clad man, with
a wizened, bearded face.</p>

<p class='c008'>... “Repent ... repent ... and
save your souls to-night from the
eternal torments of hell-fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The women jostled him, pelted him
with foul gibes; and one—a young
girl—broke into a peal of hysterical
laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>And I mused wonderingly on
the ugliness of sin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>IN ST. JAMES’S PARK</h2><br />January 15</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>A sullen glow throbs overhead:
golden will-o’-wisps are
threading their shadowy groupings
of gaunt-limbed trees; and the dull,
distant rumour of feverish London
waits on the still, night air. The
lights of Hyde Park corner blaze
like some monster, gilded constellation,
shaming the dingy stars; and
across the East there flares a sky-sign—a
gaudy, crimson arabesque.</p>

<p class='c008'>And all the air hangs draped in
the mysterious, sumptuous splendour
of a murky London
night....</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The city disgorges.</p>

<p class='c008'>All along the Strand, down
the great, ebbing tide, the omnibuses,
a congested press of gaudy craft, drift
westwards, jostling and jamming their
tall, loaded decks, with a clanking of
chains, a rumble of lumbering wheels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>a thudding of quick-loosed brakes, a
humming of hammering hoofs....</p>

<p class='c008'>The empty hansoms slink silently
past; the street hawkers—a long row
of dingy figures—line the pavement edge;
troops of frenzied newsboys
dart yelling through the traffic; and
here and there a sullen-faced woman
struggles to stem the tide of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somewhere, behind Pall Mall, unheeded
the sun has set: the sky is
powdered with crimson dust; one by
one the shops gleam out, blazing
their windows of burnished glass; the
twilight throbs with a ceaseless shuffle
of hurrying feet; and over all
things hovers the spirit of
London’s grim unrest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>SUNDAY AFTERNOON</h2><br />February 20</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was a little street, shabbily symmetrical—a
double row of insignificant,
dingy-brick houses. Muffled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>in the dusk of the fading winter afternoon,
it seemed sunk in squalid, listless
slumber. In the distance a church-bell
was tolling its joyless mechanical
Sunday tale.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man stood in the roadway, droning
the words of a hymn-tune. He
was old and decayed and sluttish: he
wore an ancient, baggy frock-coat,
and, through the cracks in his boots,
you could see the red flesh of his feet.
His gait was starved and timid: the
touch of the air was very bitter. And
when he had finished his singing, he
remained gazing up at the rows of
lifeless windows, with a look of
dull expectancy in his bloodshot,
watery eyes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><h2>RÊVERIE</h2><br />April 15</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The English Midlands, sluggishly
effluent, a massy profusion of
well-upholstered undulations; Normandy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>coquettish, almost dapper,
in its discreet rusticity, its finikin
spruceness, its distinguished reticence
of detail; the plains of Lombardy in
midsummer, all glutted with luscious
vegetation; Switzerland, tricked out
in cheap sentimentality, in a catchpenny
crudity of tone; Andalucia,
savagely harsh, with its bitter, exasperated
colouring....</p>

<p class='c008'>In every country there links a personality,
and the contemplation of the
memories of the lands where one has
lived, of the books one has cherished,
of the women one has loved, brings
with it a strange sense of the incomprehensible
promptings of caprice.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the fluctuations of mood,
Musset seems puerile or passionate;
Amiel, lachrymose or exquisitely perceptive;
Baudelaire, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">macabre</span></i> or impassively
statuesque; Pater, tortuous
or infinitely dexterous; Meredith,
irksome or gorgeously prismatic.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are women whom we worshipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>years ago, who would certainly
fail to move us to-day; books
that enthralled us in our childhood,
which we hesitate to open again;
places we had read of with delight,
and for that reason shrink from surveying.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>And so to-night, beneath the lime-tree,
by the dog-rose hedge, whilst
the grasshoppers scrape their ceaseless
chorus, and the flies roam like
specks of gold, and the fawn-coloured
cattle stalk home from the pastures,
I wonder dreamily how I have come
to love so steadfastly the whole wayward
grace of this country-side—the
melancholy of its wide plains, burnt
to dun colour by the Southern sun;
the desolate silence of those dark,
endless pine forests that lie beyond;
the hesitating contours of wooded
slopes; the distant Pyrenees, a long,
ragged, snow-capped wall; the dazzling-white
roads, stretching between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>their tall, slim poplars, straight towards
the horizon; the tumble-down,
white-faced villages, huddled on the
hilltops; their battered, sloping roofs,
tilted all awry, like loose-fitting,
peaked caps of faded-red tiles; the
farmyards, strewn with dingy ox-bedding,
and littered with a decrepit
multitude of objects, which, it seems,
can never have been new—broken
earthenware pots, rickety, rush-bottomed
chairs, stacks of dead branches,
still rustling their brown, winter
leaves; the slow-paced oxen ploughing
the land; the peasants, men,
women, and children, swaying in line
as they sow the maize, with the
poultry pecking behind; the jangling
bells of the dilapidated, yellow-wheeled
courier; the market-days, the sea of
blue <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bérets</span></i>, the press of blue blouses,
the incoherent waving of ox-goads,
the bristling of curved horns, the
shifting mass of sleek, fawn-coloured
backs; the narrow, ramshackle streets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of the town; the line of plane-trees
on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place d’armes</span></i>, beneath which
groups of grave <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> are for ever
pacing; and the Gave, spurting over
the rocks, under the old Norman
bridge....</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The sun slips behind a bank of
inky cloud, slowly trailing its pale-green
stain, and the old, penetrating
charm of this tiny corner of the
earth returns, and the old longing to
bind myself to it, to have my place
in its life, always, through the years
to come....</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The oxen have gone their way
along the road; the lengthy twilight
shadows steal across the garden; from
the church-spire up on the hill the
Angelus rings out; quite near at
hand a tree-frog starts piping his
shrill, clear note, and the cockchafers
their angry whirling; and then, of a
sudden, the violet night has fallen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>wrapping all earth and sky in her
mysterious, impenetrable
blackness....</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Have you never longed to
wander there, in that wonderful
cloudland beyond the sea,
where, like droves of monstrous cattle,
close-huddled and drowsy, they lie
the day through—the comely, milk-white
summer clouds, slow and sleek
and swelling; the quick-scudding
darkling clouds, tattered with travelling
across the sky; the mighty
thunder-clouds, violet and lowering;
the flocks of fluffy-white baby clouds;
and all the sun’s great gaudy guard,
from the daintily gilded sunset spars
to the blood-red bands that frequent
the South?</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, at even-fall, when the
sea lies calm in her opal tints, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>may discern the distant lines of their
strange, fantastic home, vague, phantasmagoric,
like a mirage beyond the
horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps, after death, we may linger
there, and watch them silently sail
away towards the lands we have
loved long ago!...</p>
